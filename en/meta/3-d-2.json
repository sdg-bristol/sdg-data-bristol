The rate gives the annual rolling rate for a given month. In this calculation, the numerator is the sum of the cases for the current month and the 11 preceeding months. The denominator is the sum of the bed days for the current month and the 11 preceeding months.\r\n\r\nThe rate for a month is then calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator and multiplying by 100,000 to give a manageable value.","other_information":"These data do not provide a basis for decisions on the clinical effectiveness of infection control interventions in individual Trusts: further investigations considering potential confounders would need to be undertaken before this could be done.\r\n\r\nNor do these data provide a basis for comparisons between acute Trust or CCGs. Rate information, using rate calculations as currently defined, is not appropriate for comparison. The counts of infections have not been adjusted to give a standardised rate considering factors such as organisational demographics or case mix. Rate information is of use for comparison of an individual organisation over time.\r\n\r\n\u2018All reported cases\u2019 refers to all MRSA-positive blood cultures reported by the Trust whose laboratory processes the specimen.
