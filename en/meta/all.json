whole, each English region, and each local authority. Life expectancy at birth is calculated for each deprivation decile of lower super output areas within each area and then the slope index of inequality (SII) is calculated based on these figures. The SII is a measure of the social gradient in life expectancy, i.e. how much life expectancy varies with deprivation. It takes account of health inequalities across the whole range of deprivation within each area and summarises this in a single number. This represents the range in years of life expectancy across the social gradient from most to least deprived, based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and deprivation across all deprivation deciles.\r\n\r\nLife expectancy at birth is a measure of the average number of years a person would expect to live based on contemporary mortality rates. For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life.","computation_calculations":"No additional calculations were performed on this dataset and it is presented as found","other_information":"Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in each area (England, region, local authority) were ranked in order of deprivation using overall IMD scores from the appropriate version of IMD (see point 2 below). They were then divided into ten categories or 'deprivation deciles' with approximately equal numbers of LSOAs in each. LSOA-level mortality data and population estimates were aggregated to these deprivation deciles. Life expectancy at birth was then calculated for each of the ten deprivation deciles in each area, for males and females separately.\r\n\r\nThe slope index of inequality (SII) is a measure of the social gradient in life expectancy, i.e. how much life expectancy varies with deprivation. It takes account of health inequalities across the whole range of deprivation within each area and summarises this in a single number. This represents the range in years of life expectancy across the social gradient from most to least deprived, based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and deprivation across all deprivation deciles.\r\n\r\nThe SII is calculated using population-weighted linear regression. To allow for differences in population size between deprivation deciles, each is given a rank score based on the midpoint of its range in the cumulative distribution of the area's population. The deciles are first ordered from most deprived to least deprived. If decile 1 then contains 12% of the population, its rank score 1 would be 12/2=6. If decile 2 includes 10% of the population, its rank score would be 12+(10/2)=17. The life expectancy for each decile is plotted against this rank score and a population-weighted regression line is fitted to the data by the least squares method. The SII is the gradient of the resulting fitted line.\r\n\r\nIMD 2010 has been used to define deprivation deciles for data up to 2009-11 (currently at England level only). IMD 2015 has been used to define deprivation deciles for time periods 2010-12 to 2015-17, and IMD 2019 has been used to define deprivation deciles for 2016-18. In doing this, areas are grouped into deprivation deciles using the Index of Multiple Deprivation which most closely aligns with the time period of the data. This provides a more accurate way of examining changes over time by deprivation.\r\n\r\nA guide to interpretation, data sources and method of calculation for the PHOF overarching indicators is

Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. Official estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises.

At the time of their introduction, CSPs were formed to match each Local Authority (LA) area. As a result of mergers of both LAs and CSPs, availability of data for LAs in England changes from year to year.\n\nWith the November 2020 update, CSPs are still aligned to pre-April 2019 geographies. As such, rates could not be gathered for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole and Dorset individually, as the counts are collated under the old geographies Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset County Council. In order to present a rate for these areas, these two unitary authorities have had their counts and populations combined, with the same rate presented for both unitary authorities.\n\nWhere an area has no numerator or denominator data displayed, the rate is combined with another area(s). If there is more than one local authority within the CSP, and if all of these local authorities are categorised within the same deprivation decile, the counts and denominators will be included in the deprivation decile. If there is more than one local authority within the CSP, but the local authorities are in multiple deprivation deciles, the counts and denominators are excluded from the deprivation deciles. Please see 'Information on police recorded crime at CSP level' for further details:  https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/recordedcrimedataatcommunitysafetypartnershiplocalauthoritylevel/current/prclocalauthoritytables.zip\u201d\n\nData for CSP Manchester Airport has been excluded from the analysis. \n\nIt is not appropriate to RAG rate this indicator as it is difficult to determine whether high or low levels of sexual offences are due high or low prevalence, or high or low levels of recording.\n\nData within the police recorded crime tables data source are updated on a quarterly basis. Timepoints for the PHOF indicator are updated on an annual basis -  the data available are currently correct as of 17 July 2020.

Crime data are produced at Community Safety Partnership (CSP) level. At the time of their introduction, CSPs were formed to match each Local Authority (LA) area. As a result of mergers of both LAs and CSPs, availability of data for LAs in England changes from year to year.\r\n\r\nWith the November 2020 update, CSPs are still aligned to pre-April 2019 geographies. As such, rates could not be gathered for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole and Dorset individually, as the counts are collated under the old geographies Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset County Council. In order to present a rate for these areas, these two unitary authorities have had their counts and populations combined, with the same rate presented for both unitary authorities.\r\n\r\nWhere an area has no numerator or denominator data displayed, the rate is combined with another area(s). If there is more than one local authority within the CSP, and if all of these local authorities are categorised within the same deprivation decile, the counts and denominators will be included in the deprivation decile. If there is more than one local authority within the CSP, but the local authorities are in multiple deprivation deciles, the counts and denominators are excluded from the deprivation deciles.

This is available through the following link: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=LUP_LAD_CSP_PFA\nAt present, the lookup from LA to PFA is geographically coterminous when aggregating district councils to county councils, meaning that this lookup can be used in conjunction with a lookup aggregating from Local Authority District to Counties, in order to find the PFA for each upper tier LA. The latest lookup for Local Authority District to Counties is available through the following link:  https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=LUP_LAD_CTY\nCalculate the total number of domestic abuse-related offences and incidents by summing the number of domestic abuse-related offences from Table 9 with the number of domestic abuse-related incidents from Table 10, by Police Force Area and time period.\nGather the mid-year population estimates of those aged 16 and over for each upper tier LA, for the preceding calendar year. For example, if calculating the number of domestic abuse-related offences and incidents for the year 2015/16, the 2014 mid-year population estimates would be used. Mid-year population estimates are available through the following link: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland\nUsing the lookup created to allocate PFAs to each upper tier LA, aggregate the populations for each PFA, for each time period.\nCalculate the rate of domestic abuse-related offences and incidents for each PFA by dividing the number of domestic abuse-related offences and incidents by the mid-year population and multiplying by 1,000.\nUsing the lookup created to allocate PFAs to each upper tier LA, assign the rate of each PFA to the respective upper tier LA.\nNote \u2013 data for Government Office Region (GOR) and England are presented at source, so confidence intervals can be calculated for these regions.","other_information":"Any other info on the dataset, e.g. data control applied?","data_show_map":false,"source_organisation_1":"PHE Fingertips","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2015/16","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Bristol","source_url_1":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework/data#page/4/gid/1000041/pat/6/par/E12000009/ati/102/are/E06000023/iid/92863/age/164/sex/4","source_url_text_1":"PHE Fingertips - B11","source_release_date_1":"02/02/2021","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_other_info_1":"Local authorities are allocated the rate of the police force area in which they sit","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"5.2.1"},"3-d-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-0D-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 865kB)","graph_title":"International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"3.d.1","indicator_name":"International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness","indicator_sort_order":"03-dd-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"3","target_name":"Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks","target_id":"3.d","un_custodian_agency":"WHO","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-11-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/471d1b88575a29d7599d488bf1c5db66bd020969","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-11-16: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/471d1b88575a29d7599d488bf1c5db66bd020969","indicator":"3.d.1"},"3-4-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-3.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 65.1 KB)","graph_title":"Suicide mortality rate","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"3.4.2","indicator_definition":"Suicide mortality rates","indicator_name":"Suicide mortality rate","indicator_sort_order":"03-04-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"3","target_name":"By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being","target_id":"3.4","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-11-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/471d1b88575a29d7599d488bf1c5db66bd020969","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-11-16: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/471d1b88575a29d7599d488bf1c5db66bd020969","National comparability":"Comparable across UK local authorities","indicator_available":"Suicide mortality rate","indicator_description":"Age-standardised suicide rates for local authorities, rolling three year aggregates, deaths registered 2002 to 2019","computation_units":"Rate per 100,000 population","computation_definitions":"Data on suicide concern all deaths that were assigned underlying cause of intentional self-harm (for those aged 10 years and above).

The World Health Organisation defines the four types of female genital mutilation as follows -\r\n\r\nType 1 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).\r\n\r\nType 2 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).\r\n\r\nType 3 - (Often referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type I FGM).\r\n\r\nType 4 - All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.","computation_calculations":"No calculations","other_information":"1.
