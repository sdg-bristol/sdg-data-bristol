It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"8","target_name":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","target_id":"8.5","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"1","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-09-21","national_data_updated_date":"2021-09-21","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-09-21: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/70bd8dafc97d635c6211a92655c3668aba225ca8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-09-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-bristol/sdg-data-bristol/commit/70bd8dafc97d635c6211a92655c3668aba225ca8","National comparability":"Comparable across UK local authorities","indicator_available":"Unemployment rate","indicator_description":"Unemployment rate","computation_units":"Percentage (%) of economic active","computation_definitions":"As unemployed form a small percentage of the population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployed estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. The model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.
