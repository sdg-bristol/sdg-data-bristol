Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height. It is defined as a person\u2019s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m\u00b2).  The BMI classification of each child is derived by calculating the child's BMI centile. This calculation uses age and sex as well as height and weight to take into account different growth patterns in children at different ages.","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Data based on academic school year (September to August).","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of 4 to 5 year old children classified as underweight, or overweight (including or obese)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Nutrition, health","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Public Health England","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2006/07","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/underweight#page/3/gid/1/pat/6/par/E12000009/ati/202/are/E06000023/iid/90316/age/200/sex/4","source_url_text_1":"NCMP - underweight","source_release_date_1":"10/10/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired from the National Child Measurement Programme.","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Public Health England","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2006/07","source_geographical_coverage_2":"England","source_url_2":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/reception#page/4/gid/1/pat/6/par/E12000009/ati/202/are/E06000023/iid/20601/age/200/sex/4","source_url_text_2":"NCMP -Overweight (including obesity)","source_release_date_2":"10/10/2019","source_next_release_2":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official Statistic","source_other_info_2":"Data acquired from the National Child Measurement Programme.","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"02-02-02","comments_limitations":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
