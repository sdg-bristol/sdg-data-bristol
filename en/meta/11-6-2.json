The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3 ). Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases. Anthropogenic effects, processes, objects, or materials are those that are derived from human activities.","source_organisation_1":"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2010","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Bristol, City of","source_url_1":"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data","source_url_text_1":"Population weighted annual mean","source_release_date_1":"Sep-20","source_next_release_1":"Official Statistics","source_contact_1":"Philip.Taylor@defra.gov.uk","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"11.6.2"}
