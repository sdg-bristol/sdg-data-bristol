In national accounts GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services. Industrial sectors are defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. The UK standard industrial classification of economic activities, abbreviated as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic activity.
