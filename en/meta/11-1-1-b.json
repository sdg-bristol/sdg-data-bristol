It is also associated with adverse health, education and social outcomes, particularly for children. To be deemed statutorily homeless a household must have become unintentionally homeless and must be considered to be in priority need. As such, statutorily homeless households contain some of the most vulnerable and needy members of our communities. Preventing and tackling homelessness requires sustained and joined-up interventions by central and local government, health and social care and the voluntary sector.\n\nThis indicator is a Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) department impact indicator. These data demonstrate the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation awaiting a settled home.\n\nHouseholds that are accepted as being homeless or are in temporary accommodation can have greater public health needs than the population as a whole.","data_show_map":false,"source_organisation_1":"PHE Fingertips","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2010/11","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Bristol","source_url_1":"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/statutory%20homelessness#page/4/gid/1/pat/6/par/E12000009/ati/102/are/E06000023/iid/11502/age/-1/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0","source_url_text_1":"PHE Fingertips","source_release_date_1":"06/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"11.1.1.b"}
