Individuals in the Annual Population Survey (APS) are classified to the public or private sector according to their responses to the survey. Consequently, the classification of an individuals sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. Official estimates of public sector employment compiled from QPSES are generally lower than estimates available from APS. This is partially because many people who work within public sector premises, whilst being employed by private sector organizations, will classify themselves as working in the public sector, e.g. cleaners or security guards employed by a contractor to work at public sector premises. Results of QPSES are available at: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/index.html A brief guide to sources of public sector data is available from here:  http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pse/public-sector-employment/a-brief-guide-to-sources-of-public-sector-employment-statistics/index.html.","source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2004","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Bristol","source_url_1":"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?changing=yes&dataset=17&anal=5&version=0","source_url_text_1":"Annual Population Survey","source_release_date_1":"13/10/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistics","source_contact_1":"support@nomisweb.co.uk","source_other_info_1":"Using January to December survey periods as annual figures","source_active_1":true,"indicator":"16.7.1"}
