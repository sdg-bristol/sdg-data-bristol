National comparability,Comparable across UK local authorities
Unit of measurement,"Rate of fatal injuries per 100,000 workers and non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 employees"
Definitions,
Calculations,Total number of fatal injuries = fatal injuries by employees + fatal injuries by self-employed
Other information,"Injury estimates are not presented for the self-employed, due to severe under-reporting (under-reporting also effects employee reports but to a lesser extent than for the self-employed. While the enforcing authorities are informed about almost all relevant fatal workplace injuries, it is known that non-fatal injuries are substantially under-reported. Currently, it is estimated that around half of all such injuries to employees are reported. These results are achieved by comparing reported non-fatal injuries, with results from the Labour Force Survey - Injuries."

Source 1 other information,"The Annual Population Survey (APS) is the source of employment data used as the denominator for rates of injury in these tables. The rate is constructed by dividing the count of injuries by the employment estimate. This is then multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to give a rate per 100,000 workers, in line with international standards"
