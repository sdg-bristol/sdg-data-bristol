Other information,"Please note that the data on statutory homelessness, only counts those who have applied and are elligable for support.  Data on statutory homelessness from before 2018 is not comparable to the data shown here, due a change in the way data is collected.   The data on rough sleeping is based on a snaphot,  an estimate based on one day a  year where those who are rough sleeping are counted.  For further information on data collection, defintions around rough sleeping and statutory homelessness please refer to the following page: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/homelessness-statistics/theme-home.html"
