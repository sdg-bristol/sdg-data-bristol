National comparability,Comparable across UK local authorities
Unit of measurement,"Rate per 100,000 population"
Definitions,"Data on suicide concern all deaths that were assigned underlying cause of intentional self-harm (for those aged 10 years and above). We also include deaths caused by injury or poisoning of undetermined intent (for those aged 15 years and above), based on the assumption that the majority of these deaths will be suicide. This is referred to as the National Statistics definition of suicide. ICD–10–CM codes for nonfatal suicide attempts and intentional self-harm include - X71–X83"
Calculations,No calculations
Other information,"Figures are for deaths registered, rather than deaths occurring in each calendar year. Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered. Figures are for a 3 year rolling period and the dates given are for the middle year. For Example the period of 2002-2004 will be reported as 2003"
