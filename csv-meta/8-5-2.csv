National comparability,Comparable across UK local authorities
Unit of measurement,Percentage (%) of economic active
Definitions,"As unemployed form a small percentage of the population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployed estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. The model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes. Unemployment figure is for economic active person aged 16 and over"
