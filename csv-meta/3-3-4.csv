Source 1 other information,"Every effort is made to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data. At a national level, data are de-duplicated to prevent double counting of the same individual. The sum of the local authority data may not equal the regional and overall England data because for some individuals only the region or country of residence is available. In 2016, 98% of cases could be mapped to a lower/upper tier local authority. The surveillance definition for acute hepatitis B is 'HBsAg positive, anti-HBc IgM positive and abnormal liver function tests with a pattern consistent with acute viral hepatitis'."
