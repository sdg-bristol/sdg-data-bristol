Visits to the natural environment are defined as time spent ""out of doors"" e.g. in open spaces in and around towns and cities, including parks, canals and nature areas; the coast and beaches; and the countryside including farmland, woodland, hills and rivers.

This could be anything from a few minutes to all day. It may include time spent close to home or workplace, further afield or while on holiday in England.

However this does not include things such as routine shopping trips or time spent in own garden"
