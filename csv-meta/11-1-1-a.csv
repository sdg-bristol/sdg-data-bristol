Calculations,"From source: ""By dividing the house price for a given area by its earnings, we produce a ratio which serves as an indicator of relative affordability. A higher ratio indicates that on average, it is less affordable for a resident to purchase a house in their local authority district. Conversely, a lower ratio indicates higher affordability in a local authority. While there are many more factors that influence affordability, the simple ratio provides an overview of geographic differences across England"""
