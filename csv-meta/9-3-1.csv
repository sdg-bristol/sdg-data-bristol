Definitions,"Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. In national accounts GVA is output minus intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services. Industrial sectors are defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. The UK standard industrial classification of economic activities, abbreviated as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic activity. The current UK standard industrial classification of economic activities was completed in 2007 and effective from 01/01/2008."
Calculations,(Industry Sector GVA/Total GVA)*100
Other information,"GVA estimates are presented in 'real' terms, with the effect of inflation removed, as chained volume measures (CVM) in money terms (using 2016 values). Therefore percentages will not add up to 100%"
