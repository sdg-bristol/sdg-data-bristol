Indicator content,"Proxy indicator - Original indicator: <br/> The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries
  by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically
  sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is
  considered biologically unsustainable."
