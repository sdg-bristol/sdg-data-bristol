Domestic abuse related offences and incidents are defined as threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults, aged 16 and over, who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality.  Offences have been recorded as a crime, whereas the number of incidents refers to those that were not recorded as a crime and the two categories are mutually exclusive.",,

Source 1 other information,"Figures for domestic abuse incidents in previous years were not split into incidents and crimes, but contained all incidents regardless of whether they were treated as a crime or not. This figures in this indicator include the new methodology which captures data relating to the new categories of all domestic abuse related crimes and domestic abuse related incidents. These figures are not comparable with data released in previous years. It is difficult to obtain reliable information on the extent of domestic abuse as there is a degree of under-reporting of these incidents. Changes in the level of domestic abuse incidents reported to the police are particularly likely to be affected by changes in recording practices. These kinds of changes may in part be due to greater encouragement by the police to victims to come forward and improvements in police recording, rather than an increase in the level of victimisation. ",,
