Oxacillin
Cefoxitin
Flucloxacillin "
Calculations,"No additional calculations have been applied and the dataset is presented as found, the dataset states that the calculations performed in creating it are as follows. The rate gives the annual rolling rate for a given month. In this calculation, the numerator is the sum of the cases for the current month and the 11 preceeding months. The denominator is the sum of the bed days for the current month and the 11 preceeding months.

The rate for a month is then calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator and multiplying by 100,000 to give a manageable value."
Other information,"These data do not provide a basis for decisions on the clinical effectiveness of infection control interventions in individual Trusts: further investigations considering potential confounders would need to be undertaken before this could be done.

Nor do these data provide a basis for comparisons between acute Trust or CCGs. Rate information, using rate calculations as currently defined, is not appropriate for comparison. The counts of infections have not been adjusted to give a standardised rate considering factors such as organisational demographics or case mix. Rate information is of use for comparison of an individual organisation over time.

‘All reported cases’ refers to all MRSA-positive blood cultures reported by the Trust whose laboratory processes the specimen. It is important to note that this does not necessarily imply that the infection was acquired there."
